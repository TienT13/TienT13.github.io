## Tien Anh Khoi Tran's Porfolio

I am a computer science major at SUF and I plan on graduating in 2029.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 3:
I enjoyed both parts of this lab as it is very easy to understand and was very fun. We learned how to integrate calculations and formulas into a program to find the date difference and the BMR.

Lab 5 part 2:
This was my 2nd most favorite lab because it taught me how to convert decimal feet to inches and feet. This was particularly interesting because from this I learned to apply more complex formula into my programs.

Lab 9 part 2:
I also really enjoyed this lab because it taught me how to use loops to perform tasks within the program. In this lab we were told to use a loop to find the secret number. This lab was interesting because it was very easy and interesting to do. My partner and I had a lot of fun doing this.
