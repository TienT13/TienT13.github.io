## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 3:

    Lab 3 was one of my favorite labs because it was easy to follow and enjoyable to work on. I liked this lab because it showed me how calculations and formulas can be integrated into a program to solve real problems. Through this lab, I learned how to calculate date differences and determine BMR values, which helped me understand how math and programming work together.

* Lab 5 part 2:

    Lab 5 Part 2 was one of my favorite labs because it challenged me to apply more complex formulas in my code. I found it interesting because I learned how to convert decimal feet into feet and inches accurately. This lab helped me improve my problem-solving skills and showed me how mathematical conversions can be implemented correctly in a program.

* Lab 9 part 2:

    Lab 9 Part 2 was a favorite because it helped me better understand how loops work in programming. I enjoyed this lab because we used a loop to repeatedly test values until the correct secret number was found. From this lab, I learned how loops can automate repetitive tasks and make programs more efficient, and my partner and I had fun working through the logic together.
