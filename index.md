## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 3:

    I enjoyed both parts of this lab because it was easy to understand and fun to complete. Through this lab, I learned how to integrate calculations and formulas into a program, such as calculating date differences and determining BMR.

* Lab 5 part 2:

    This was my second favorite lab because it taught me how to convert decimal feet into feet and inches. I found this lab particularly interesting because it helped me apply more complex formulas within my programs.

* Lab 9 part 2:

    I really enjoyed this lab because it taught me how to use loops to perform repeated tasks within a program. In this lab, we used a loop to find a secret number. This activity was engaging and helped me better understand how loops work. My partner and I had a lot of fun completing this lab together.
